# level-up-web-components-demo
This is the code used in the [Level Up with projekt202 - Application Development With Web Components](https://www.meetup.com/projekt202/events/276547068/) demo.

## How to run
Simply host the `index.html` with your favorite HTTP server!

If you don't have one set up, [`live-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) is quick and easy to set up as long as you have `NPM` set up on your machine.

### To install
```sh
npm i -g live-server
```

### To run
```sh
live-server
```
